    "# QM9 KRR Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "Code to perform KRR on the QM9 dataset using different Nystrom methods, using 100k randomly selected molecules as training points. The l1 Laplace kernel is used with a bandwidth 5120, and the regularization parameter is 1e-8; both were chosen using cross-validation. This code was used to produce Figure 3 in the manuscript together with `matlab_plotting/make_krr_plots.m`"
